package treeNode

//Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root,
// return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

//Note:
//The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
//The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.

// The algorithm of this problem is same to problem 783
